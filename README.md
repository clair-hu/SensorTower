# Outlines
-   Sensor tower

    -   Mac version

        -   AI Based algorithm

            -   creating new virtual environment for opencv and yolo

                -   using pre-trained yolov3 model

                    -   two use cases

                        -   on webcam

                        -   on video

        -   non AI based algorithm

            -   After tuning parameters, I found that the performance of
                the object detection is related with the frame size set
                by opencv.

                -   the speed of the python script is related with frame
                    size

                    -   need to decrease frame size to ensure the speed

            -   Background cleaning

                -   two methods

                    -   background subtractor by openCV

                        -   MOG

                            -   pros

                                -   works good on mac

                                -   performance better on android
                                    application

                        -   MOG2

                            -   pros

                                -   invariant to lighting change

                            -   cons

                                -   too much noise in practise

                        -   GMG

                            -   with most noice

                        -   <https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html>

                    -   running average

                        -   over a number of frames

                        -   algorithm developed by clair

            -   auto object initialization

                -   get clean background

                    -   subtract the current frame from the clean
                        background

            -   Apply KCF object tracker to moving object

            -   Apply multiple kcf trackers

                -   two methods

                    -   using multiTracker class by openCV

                        -   only has one response for whole trackers

                    -   customized vector of trackers

                        -   have response (success/failure) for each
                            trackers

                            -   easy for tracker management

                                -   success

            -   Apply multiple type of trackers

                -   KCF

                    -   fastest

                -   Boosting

                -   MIL

            -   Get direction of moving object

                -   kcf tracker does not provide direction vector

                -   get directions from movement of the center of the
                    bounding boxes

        -   implemented in python

            -   code in github

                -   write README in github

                    -   connect the sequence of mindmap and codebase in
                        github
