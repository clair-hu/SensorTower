# SensorTower


## Non AI based algorithm

### Flow

1. Background cleaning

2. auto object initialization

3. Apply KCF object tracker to moving object

4. Apply multiple kcf trackers

5. Apply multiple type of trackers

6. Get direction of moving object

## AI based algorithm

### Flow

1. creating new virtual environment for opencv and yolo

2. using pre-trained yolov3 model

3. train customized yolo model with pre-trained yolotiny model


### Note
Due to git size limitation, raw images and resized images are back up in google drive.
